Neutron stars are of particular interest to physicists for several reasons. One of the main reasons is that neutron stars are made up of nuclear matter (think protons and neutrons), compressed to densities far greater than we can probe on Earth. Astrophysical observations of neutron stars allow us to learn about properties related to the structure of neutron stars; important *macro*scopic properties we can measure from gravitational wave signals from merging neutron stars are the masses and tidal deformabilities, which is a dimensionless quantity commonly denoted by $\Lambda$.

As neutron stars get closer together, they begin to feel stronger tides from one another; similar to the Earth and the moon. See the gif to the right. Because each neutron star is a finite-sized ball of matter, a tidal effect is created as it feels a tug from the other neutron star. This deformation is imprinted in the gravitational wave signal, as deforming the neutron stars costs work (expends energy), taking energy away from the orbit, so the inspiral accelerates. We observe the progression of the inspiral in the gravitational wave signal as the
