				<h2>Hierarchical Inference of Binary Neutron Star Mass Distribution and Equation of State with Gravitational Waves</h2>
				<p>14 September 2024</p>
			</header><p>Neutron stars are of particular interest to physicists for several reasons. One of the main reasons is that neutron stars are made up of nuclear matter (think protons and neutrons), compressed to densities far greater than we can probe on Earth. Astrophysical observations of neutron stars allow us to learn about properties related to the structure of neutron stars; important <em>macro</em>scopic properties we can measure from gravitational wave signals from merging neutron stars are the masses and tidal deformabilities, which is a dimensionless quantity commonly denoted by $\Lambda$. 
<img src="https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/gravity-and-bulges.gif" alt="From NASA" style="float: right; width: 40%; margin-left: 15px;" /></p>

<p>As neutron stars get closer together, they begin to feel stronger tides from one another, similar to the Earth and the moon. See the gif to the right. Because each neutron star is a finite-sized ball of matter, a tidal effect is created as it feels a tug from the other neutron star. This deformation is imprinted in the gravitational wave signal, as deforming the neutron stars costs work (expends energy), taking energy away from the orbit, so the inspiral accelerates. We observe the progression of the inspiral in the gravitational wave signal as we track the observed phase evolution. The tidal deformability $\Lambda$ of each neutron star is the tidal parameter that affects the phase evolution and thus is an observable quantity in the signal. The size of $\Lambda$ depends on the size (radius, as it is spherical to lowest order) of the star and its so-called “Love number” (basically how rigid it is). Both of these properties ultimately depend on the nuclear interaction at the densities reached inside the star. Whereas with black hole mergers, we only measure the mass and spins of the objects, when we observe neutron star mergers the tidal effects in the waveform tell us about the size and rigity of the neutron star. This relationship between tidal deformability and mass can teach us about the behavior of dense nuclear matter.</p>

<p>In order to learn from multiple observations, we combine them using hierarchical Bayesian inference. One thing we want to learn from neutron star mergers is the mass distribution of neutron stars in binaries observed in gravitational waves. Neutron stars in the Milky Way come from a mass distribution that looks something like a double peaked population extending from $\sim 1 M_\odot$ to $\sim 2.1-2.5 M_\odot$. Do the neutron stars we observe in gravitational waves, which are obviously in other galaxies, come from a similar population to the Milky Way neutorn stars? What is the maximum mass of neutron stars in the population? Are there any other interesting features in the mass distribution that can reveal something about the formation of the systems that merge?</p>

<p>In order to answer the above questions, we need to quanitfy, for each event, how likely the data we observed from that event is given some assumed population model. If we have a catalog of many events, the total likelihood is an <em>and</em> problem, so we simply calculate this number for all events in our catalog and take the product.</p>

<p>However, the measurements of the masses we made for each observation are correlated with the measurements of the tides. In other words, they are not measured completely independently from the data, and therefore an assumption you make about one will affect the other. <em>You need to measure or infer the equation of state properties simulateneously with the mass distribution in order to avoid a bias</em>. This is true to some extent for properties involving any correlated observables.</p>

<p>In this paper, we show this is the case. When you infer the mass distribution and ignore the effects of the EoS, you get a biased answer. See the figure to the right in which we show the results from a simulation study. The blue and red are just two different parts of the mass distribution, but the point is the inferred distribution (shaded) systematically deviates from the true simulated distribution (dashed lines) when we do not model the EoS in our inference.</p>

<p>How do we address this? This is where the discussion becomes a bit more technical. In order to calculate the likelihood of a single event (with data $d$), conditioned on some population parameters $\eta$ and EoS $\epsilon$, we have to calculate integrals like \(p(d \mid \eta, \epsilon) = \int p(d \mid m, \Lambda) \pi(m, \Lambda \mid \eta, \epsilon) \ dm \ d\Lambda\).
Notice that this is just the marginal likelihood over the observables mass and tidal deformability. When we marginalize over a likeliood (probability of the data) we need to choose a prior $\pi$. In our case, our prior should be the assumed mass distribution, which we express as $\pi(m \mid \eta)$, as this is the probability of the mass $m$, given the parameters $\eta$ describing the population model.</p>

<p>Where does the EoS enter into this? For a given EoS, there is a one-to-one mapping between the tidal deformability $\Lambda$ and the mass. In other words, the EoS fully prescribes what the tidal deformability of a neutron star is at a given mass. Mathematically, the probability of the tidal deformability is a delta function conditioned on the mass and EoS: $\pi(\Lambda \mid m, \epsilon) = \delta (\Lambda - \Lambda(\epsilon, m) \mid m, \epsilon)$, making our population prior $\pi(m, \Lambda \mid \eta, \epsilon) = \pi(m \mid \eta) \delta (\Lambda - \Lambda(\epsilon, m) \mid m, \epsilon)$. The presence of this delta function makes our standard Monte Carlo importance sampling-based methods impossible for calculating this integral. In this paper, we introduce a method based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to efficiently and accurately evaluate integrals such as the above. We implement some interesting and convenient transformations to make this density estimation procedure possible and make the whole evaluation process and integral calculation run on a GPU.</p>
