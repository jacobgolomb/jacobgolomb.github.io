As a first application of this method, we use the binary black hole mergers observed during the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA third observation run to test the spatial distribution of these sources. We find no evidence for anisotropy in their angular distribution. We discuss further applications of this method to investigate other gravitational-wave source populations and their correlations to the cosmological large-scale structure.}

abstract = {Observations of gravitational waves emitted by merging compact binaries have provided tantalizing hints about stellar astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. However, the physical parameters describing the systems (mass, spin, distance) used to extract these inferences about the Universe are subject to large uncertainties. The most widely used method of performing these analyses requires performing many Monte Carlo integrals to marginalize over the uncertainty in the properties of the individual binaries and the survey selection bias. These Monte Carlo integrals are subject to fundamental statistical uncertainties. Previous treatments of this statistical uncertainty have focused on ensuring that the precision of the inferred inference is unaffected; however, these works have neglected the question of whether sufficient accuracy can also be achieved. In this work, we provide a practical exploration of the impact of uncertainty in our analyses and provide a suggested framework for verifying that astrophysical inferences made with the gravitational-wave transient catalogue are accurate. Applying our framework to models used by the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA collaboration and in the wider literature, we find that Monte Carlo uncertainty in estimating the survey selection bias is the limiting factor in our ability to probe narrow population models and this will rapidly grow more problematic as the size of the observed population increases.}}

    abstract = {The spins of black holes in merging binaries can reveal information related to the formation and evolution of these systems through their gravitational wave emission. Combining events to infer the astrophysical distribution of black hole spins allows us to determine the relative contribution from different formation scenarios to the population. Many previous works have modeled spin population distributions using parametric models. While these are valuable approaches when the observed population is small, they make strong assumptions about the shape of the underlying distribution and are highly susceptible to biases due to mismodeling. The results obtained with such parametric models are only valid if the allowed shape of the distribution is well-motivated (i.e. for astrophysical reasons). In this work, we relax these prior assumptions and model the spin distributions using a more data-driven approach, modeling these distributions with flexible cubic spline interpolants in order to allow for capturing structures that the parametric models cannot. We find that adding this flexibility to the model substantially increases the uncertainty in the inferred distributions, but find a general trend for lower support at high spin magnitude and a spin tilt distribution consistent with isotropic orientations. We infer that 62 - 87% of black holes have spin magnitudes less than a = 0.5, and 27- 50% of black holes exhibit negative $\chi_{\rm eff}$. Using the inferred $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution, we place a conservative upper limit of 37% for the contribution of hierarchical mergers to the astrophysical BBH population. Additionally, we find that artifacts from unconverged Monte Carlo integrals in the likelihood can manifest as spurious peaks and structures in inferred distributions, mandating the use of a sufficient number of samples when using Monte Carlo integration for population inference.}

However, many of our current procedures for computing these constraints will not scale well with the increased size of future transient catalogs. We introduce a novel hybrid sampling method in order to more efficiently perform parameterized tests of general relativity with gravitational-wave signals. Applying our method to the binary black hole merger GW150914 and simulated signals we find that our method is approximately an order of magnitude more efficient than the current method with conservative settings for our hybrid analysis. While we have focused on the specific problem of measuring potential deviations from relativity, our method is of much wider applicability to any problem that can be decomposed into a simple and more complex model(s).}

    abstract = {Measurement of spin-precession in black hole binary mergers observed with gravitational waves is an exciting milestone as it relates to both general relativistic dynamics and astrophysical binary formation scenarios. In this study, we revisit the evidence for spin-precession in GW200129 and localize its origin to data in LIGO Livingston in the 20--50\,Hz frequency range where the signal amplitude is lower than expected from a non-precessing binary given all the other data. These data are subject to known data quality issues as a glitch was subtracted from the detector's strain data. The lack of evidence for spin-precession in LIGO Hanford leads to a noticeable inconsistency between the inferred binary mass ratio and precessing spin in the two LIGO detectors, something not expected from solely different Gaussian noise realizations. We revisit the LIGO Livingston glitch mitigation and show that the difference between a spin-precessing and a non-precessing interpretation for GW200129 is smaller than the statistical and systematic uncertainty of the glitch subtraction, finding that the support for spin-precession depends sensitively on the glitch modeling. We also investigate the signal-to-noise ratio $\sim7$ trigger in the less sensitive Virgo detector. Though not influencing the spin-precession studies, the Virgo trigger is grossly inconsistent with the ones in LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston as it points to a much heavier system. We interpret the Virgo data in the context of further data quality issues. While our results do not disprove the presence of spin-precession in GW200129, we argue that any such inference is contingent upon the statistical and systematic uncertainty of the glitch mitigation. Our study highlights the role of data quality investigations when inferring subtle effects such as spin-precession for short signals such as the ones produced by high-mass systems.}

Numerous methods have been proposed to analyze the population of observed neutron stars and previous work has demonstrated the necessity of jointly fitting the astrophysical distribution and the equation of state in order to accurately constrain the equation of state. In this work, we introduce a new framework to simultaneously infer the distribution of binary neutron star masses and the nuclear equation of state using Gaussian mixture model density estimates which mitigates some of the limitations previously-used methods suffer from. Using our method, we reproduce previous projections for the expected precision of our joint mass distribution and equation of state inference with tens of observations. We also show that mismodeling the equation of state can bias our inference of the neutron star mass distribution. While we focus on neutron star masses and matter effects, our method is widely applicable to population inference problems.}

    abstract = {Comparable-mass black-hole mergers generically result in moderate to highly spinning holes, whose spacetime curvature will significantly affect nearby matter in observable ways. We investigate how the moderate spin of a post-merger Kerr black hole immersed in a plasma with initially uniform density and uniform magnetic field affects potentially observable accretion rates and energy fluxes. Varying the initial specific internal energy of the plasma over two decades, we find very little change in steady-state mass accretion rate or Poynting luminosity, except at the lowest internal energies, where fluxes do not exhibit steady-state behavior during the simulation timescale. Fixing the internal energy and varying the initial fixed magnetic-field amplitude and orientation, we find that the steady-state Poynting luminosity depends strongly on the initial field angle with respect to the black hole spin axis, while the matter accretion rate is more stable until the field angle exceeds $\sim 45\degree$. The proto-jet formed along the black hole spin-axis conforms to a thin, elongated cylinder near the hole, while aligning with the asymptotic magnetic field at large distances.}

    abstract = {The work presented here attempts at answering the question: how do we decide when a given adetection is a planet or just residual noise in exoplanet direct imaging data? To this end we present a method implemented within a Bayesian framework: (1) to unify 'source detection', and, 'source characterization' into one single rigorous mathematical framework; (2) to enable an adequate hypothesis testing given the S/N of the data; (3) to enhance the detectability of planets faint signal in the presence of instrumental and background noise and to optimize the characterization of the planet. As a proof of concept we implemented a routine named ${\tt PlanetEvidence}$ that integrates the nested sampling technique (Multinest) with a post-processing technique, the Karhunen-Loeve Image Processing (KLIP), algorithm. This is a first step to recast such post-processing method into a fully Bayesian perspective. We test our approach on real direct imaging data, specifically using GPI data of $\beta$ Pictoris b, and, on synthetic data. We find that for the former the method strongly favors the presence of a planet (as expected) and recovers the true parameter posterior distributions. While for the latter case our approach allows us to detect (true) dim sources invisible to the naked eye as real planets, rather than background noise, and set a new lower threshold for detection at the 2$\sigma$ level approximately. Further it allows us to quantify our confidence that a given detection is a real planet and not just residual noise (for example residual speckles). The next natural step is to extend this approach to construct a Bayesian-based algorithm for blind detection, that is, not requiring an initial guess as to the location of the planet. This is the subject of ongoing work.}}

  abstract = {We report on the population properties of compact binary mergers inferred from gravitational-wave observations of these systems during the first three LIGO-Virgo observing runs. The Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3 (GWTC-3) contains signals consistent with three classes of binary mergers: binary black hole, binary neutron star, and neutron star–black hole mergers. We infer the binary neutron star merger rate to be between 10 and 1700 Gpc − 3 yr − 1 and the neutron star–black hole merger rate to be between 7.8 and 140 Gpc − 3 yr − 1 , assuming a constant rate density in the comoving frame and taking the union of 90% credible intervals for methods used in this work. We infer the binary black hole merger rate, allowing for evolution with redshift, to be between 17.9 and 44 Gpc − 3 yr − 1 at a fiducial redshift ( z = 0.2 ). The rate of binary black hole mergers is observed to increase with redshift at a rate proportional to ( 1 + z ) κ with κ = 2. 9 + 1.7 − 1.8 for z ≲ 1 . Using both binary neutron star and neutron star–black hole binaries, we obtain a broad, relatively flat neutron star mass distribution extending from 1.2 + 0.1 − 0.2 to 2.0 + 0.3 − 0.3 M ⊙ . We confidently determine that the merger rate as a function of mass sharply declines after the expected maximum neutron star mass, but cannot yet confirm or rule out the existence of a lower mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. We also find the binary black hole mass distribution has localized over- and underdensities relative to a power-law distribution, with peaks emerging at chirp masses of 8.3 + 0.3 − 0.5 and 27.9 + 1.9 − 1.8 M ⊙ . While we continue to find that the mass distribution of a binary’s more massive component strongly decreases as a function of primary mass, we observe no evidence of a strongly suppressed merger rate above approximately 60 M ⊙ , which would indicate the presence of a upper mass gap. Observed black hole spins are small, with half of spin magnitudes below χ i ≈ 0.25 . While the majority of spins are preferentially aligned with the orbital angular momentum, we infer evidence of antialigned spins among the binary population. We observe an increase in spin magnitude for systems with more unequal-mass ratio. We also observe evidence of misalignment of spins relative to the orbital angular momentum.}

      abstract = {Gravitational wave observations of binary black holes have revealed unexpected structure in the black hole mass distribution. Previous studies of the mass distribution employ physically-motivated phenomenological models and infer the parameters that directly control the features of the mass distribution that are allowed in their model, associating the constraints on those parameters with their physical motivations. In this work, we take an alternative approach in which we introduce a model parameterizing the underlying stellar and core-collapse physics and obtaining the remnant black hole distribution as a derived byproduct. In doing so, we directly constrain the stellar physics necessary to explain the astrophysical distribution of black hole properties under a given model. We apply this approach to modeling the mapping between stellar core mass and remnant black hole mass, including the effects of mass loss due to the pulsational pair instability supernova (PPISN) process, which has been proposed as an explanation for the observed excess of black holes at ∼35M⊙. Placing constraints on the nuclear reaction rates necessary to explain the PPISN parameters, we conclude that the peak observed at ∼35M⊙ is highly unlikely to be a signature from the PPISN process. This procedure can be applied to modeling any physical process that underlies the astrophysical mass distribution. Allowing the parameters of the core-remnant mass relationship to evolve with redshift permits correlated and physically reasonable changes in the location, shape, and amplitude of features in the mass function. We find that the current data are consistent with no redshift evolution in the core-remnant mass relationship, but ultimately place only weak constraints on the change of these parameters.}
