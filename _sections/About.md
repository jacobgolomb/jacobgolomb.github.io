<p>Hey, I'm Jacob. I'm currently a fourth-year physics PhD student at Caltech, studying black holes and neutron stars through the gravitational waves they emit when they collide. I am especially interested in how we can use gravitational wave observations to learn about astrophysics, general relativity, and cosmology, as well as the methods involved in these analyses.</p>

<p>I work within the <a href="https://labcit.ligo.caltech.edu/groups/astrophysics-group/">Astrophysics Group</a> in the <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">Caltech LIGO Lab</a>, where my advisor is Alan Weinstein. Within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, I am actively invovled in several working groups, including the Parameter Estimation and Rates and Populations groups.</p>

<p> Born in Northern Virginia and raised in Montgomery County, Maryland, I graduated from the University of Maryland in 2020 (amidst the start of the pandemic) with a B.S. in Physics and a B.S. in Astronomy, where I did astrophysics research and also some work on cold atom experiments. I ended up sticking with astrophysics and became interested in gravitational waves as a particular emerging tool for studying the physics of the most extreme objects in the universe, which is what brought me to Caltech.</p>

<p> Check out my resume for more on my academic background and research. I also have my publications listed and short descriptions of some of my papers.</p>
